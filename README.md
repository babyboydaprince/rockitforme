This framework is dedicated to the Security community, as it was and remains being the source
of my inspiration to maintain following the path and also fight for what I've always desired.

In This swiss army knife framework you will find a great deal of tools that keep me in company and
I believe it always will for my entire life.

It also contains tools I designed, and will have more of them.

When the first stable release comes I will leave here all my inspirations for this project.
